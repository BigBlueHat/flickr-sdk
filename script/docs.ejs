# <%= package.name %>

<%= package.description %>

## install

```
$ npm install <%= package.name %>
```

## usage

<%= package.name %> is based on [superagent][] and all methods that make API calls will return a superagent Request instance configured for the request. This means that you can do anything with Flickr requests that you can do with superagent.

The Flickr API is divided into several services:

- The [REST API][services/api] service, which provides access to Flickr data
- The [OAuth][services/oauth] service, which authenticates users via OAuth 1.0
- The [Feeds][services/feeds] service, which provides feeds of public Flickr data
- The [Upload][services/upload] service, where you can upload photos!

**Example**

``` js
var Flickr = require('<%= package.name %>');
```
